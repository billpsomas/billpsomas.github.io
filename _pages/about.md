Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am an early-career researcher in Computer Vision and Machine Learning working at [Visual Recognition Group](https://vrg.fel.cvut.cz). Most recently, I was awarded the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship 2024 for my RAVIOLI project. I successfully defended my Ph.D. dissertation titled Learning Visual and Multimodal Representations at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). Prior to that, he received a MSc in Data Science and Information Technologies with a specialization in “Big Data and Artificial Intelligence” from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and a Diploma as a Rural, Surveying and Geoinformatics Engineer from NTUA.

He has completed internships at research institutes such as Inria Rennes and the Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI). Dr. Psomas has research experience, having served as a research assistant at the Athena Research Center and NTUA. He has contributed to 4 European, 2 Greek, and 1 international research projects, co-supervised 5 Diploma/Master theses, and published 3 theses, 2 journal articles, and 8 conference and workshop papers in his fields of expertise. Additionally, he has organized 2 workshops and symposiums, served as a session chair at 1 conference, and reviewed papers for 4 journals and 7 conferences.
